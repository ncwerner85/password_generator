* Used provided HTML and CSS for the password application and added Javascript to create a working random password generator. 
* Initially created the variables for the different criteria that will be available to the user. Later changed that variables to a string.  
* Created the prompts and confirm actions that will collect the user data.
* Created if statements to validate the user input.
* Created a for loop to generate random password.
* Added if statements and alerts to insure that the user only entered the correct criteria if not they are alerted and returned to the beginning. 
* Cleaned up formatting and ran the generator several times and it is working to specified parameters.
